# resumeGen
- Created a app using the MEAN(MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js) Stack
- My Resume Gen app was created to provide anyone, regardless of access to graphic software or technical ability the chance to create a stylish resume
- The app relies on a user submitted form that contains general resume information which upon submission gets stored on a Mongo Database
- User information is extracted from the Database and put into a stylized template created with HTML5, CSS3, and Angularjs
- User has the option of printing the generated resume or saving it as a PDF
